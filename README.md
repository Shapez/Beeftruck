# Beeftruck
Beeftruck is a project I made to help me learn how to build a webscraper with python. Its function was to search googles images, and return results matching the text string "beef truck". 
you might think "well that's pointless and weird!", but you know, I feel it was a creative and fun way to learn some skills. Also, what a funny word..beeftruck. What if you got hit by a beeftruck and the term 'beeftruck' turned up an image of yourself?! That'd be crazy.
